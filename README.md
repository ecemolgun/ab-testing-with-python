# Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, ‘average bidding’, as an alternative to the existing bidding type called ‘maximum bidding’.

One company uses A/B testing to analyze whether average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. The success criterion of the relevant company is the **“Purchase”** variable and statistical tests will focus on this variable.

Maximum Bid will be applied to the control group and Average Bid to the test group.
