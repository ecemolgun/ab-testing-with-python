# Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, ‘average bidding’, as an alternative to the existing bidding type called ‘maximum bidding’.

One company uses A/B testing to analyze whether average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. The success criterion of the relevant company is the **“Purchase”** variable and statistical tests will focus on this variable.

Maximum Bid will be applied to the control group and Average Bid to the test group.

## Variables

***The following measurement methods will be used during the analysis.***

## Normality Assumption 
The normality assumption is the assumption that the data should show a normal distribution when performing a statistical analysis.

## Variance Homogeneity
Variance homogeneity is the assumption that the variances of the measured variables are similar between different groups used in statistical analysis. This assumption indicates that different groups are similar and comparable to each other.

## Two Independent Sample T-test (Parametric test)
Two independent samples t-test is a statistical analysis method used to compare means between two different groups. This test can be used when sample data has a normal distribution and variances are equal.

Two different sample datasets are used and sample sizes in these datasets may differ from each other.
