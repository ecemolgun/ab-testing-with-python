A/B Testing with Python on a business problem.

Business Problem
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, ‘average bidding’, as an alternative to the existing bidding type called ‘maximum bidding’.

One company uses A/B testing to analyze whether average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. The success criterion of the relevant company is the “Purchase” variable and statistical tests will focus on this variable.

Maximum Bid will be applied to the control group and Average Bid to the test group.

Variables
Impression: Ad views
Click: Number of clicks on the displayed ad
Purchase: The number of products purchased after the ads clicked
Earning: Earnings after purchased products
